This is a sudoku solver done in assembly x86.

The reading is done by using system interups to call the 'read' systen function.

To solve the grid the program uses a simple backtracking method. 

The completed sudoku will be displayed in 'output.txt'.

To compile the program you will need to type in the terminal 'make'.

To clean the executable and the output file type 'make clean'. 


CONVENTION FOR READING:

After a digit is inserted there need to be precisly one 'space' character between them. After a row is done you need to introduce the 'new line' character.
